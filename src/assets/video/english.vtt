[Greg, Deaf Singer]
Back when the Internet was first established, deaf people had a
great time with it.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500 line:80%
Everything was readable.
Then ...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.200 line:80%
[Ken, Deaf Listener]
Movies started showing up.
We couldn't understand them...

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000 line:80%
there were no captions!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000 line:80%
Fortunately, Google Video added support for captions.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500 line:80%
Thank you, Ken!

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.500 line:80%
Now, we've added that to YouTube.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000 line:80%
But the first thing he did with
that was RickRoll me!

[Franck, Icone de Mode]
Captions and subtitles are also helpful

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.200 line:80%
for people who speak other languages, like myself.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.000 line:80%
With subtitles, I can enjoy US Comedy, or news stories from Russia,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.500 line:80%
in my own language. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000 line:80%
As a video uploader, this means you can reach
to people all over the world, 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.500 line:80%
irrespective of language.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.000 line:80%
[Hiroto, Bedhead]
You can upload multiple tracks like English and French, 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000 line:80%
and viewers can choose the track they like.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.500 line:80%
[Toliver, Japanese Learner]
For example, if you enjoy using YouTube in French,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.000 line:80%
French captions will automatically appear.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.500 line:80%
With just a single video,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000 line:80%
you can now reach people all around the globe!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000 line:80%
The captioning capability at YouTube was just launched this summer,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.000 line:80%
and we're planning to add more features to this.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:00:00.000 line:80%
